    <h2><u><b>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:</b></u></h2>                                                                                               
    A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to
    do. Examples are: Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, and C#. Programming
    languages are used to write all computer programs and computer software. A
    programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do
    something.
    A programmer writes text in the source code of a programming language to make programs. 
    Usually, the programming language uses real words for some of the commands (e.g. "if... 
    then... else...", "and", "or"), so that the language is easier for a human to understand. 
    Like any normal language, many programming languages use punctuation. Many programs are then 
    compiled, which means that the computer changes, or translates, the source code into another
    language (such as assembly language or machine language) that a computer can read, but
    which is much harder for a person to read.
    
    Computer programs must be written very carefully. If a programmer makes mistakes, or a 
    program tries to do something the programmer did not design it to do, then the program might 
    then stop working, which is called "crashing". When a program has a problem because of how 
    the code was written, this is called a "bug". A very small mistake can cause a very big 
    problem.

<big><b>Types of programming languages:</b></big>
<p>
    <u><b>Object-oriented:-</b></u>
    Object-oriented programming languages place data and functions that change data into a single unit. This unit is 
    called an "object". Objects can interact with each other and change another object's data. This is usually called 
    encapsulation or information hiding.Most modern programming languages are object-oriented, or at least allow this style 
    of programming. Examples of this are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and other languages.
   
    There are many types of programming languages. Most programming languages do not follow one type alone, so it is difficult 
    to assign a type for each language.The examples of each type are given in each section below because they are the best 
    well-known examples of that type.
   
   <u><b>High-level vs. low-level:-</b></u>	
   This section needs more information.High-level programming languages require less knowledge about the hardware compared to low-level 
   programming languages. This is because high-level programming languages abstract away the hardware the program is running on. 
   Many high-level languages require an interpreter to run the source code on the hardware in real time. On the other hand, low-level 
   languages usually convert the whole source code to machine code before running, because the source code is so close to the hardware 
   that it is easy to do so.
   
   <u><b>Declarative vs. Imperative programming:-</b></u>
   Declarative programming languages describe a "problem" but they usually do not say how the problem should be solved. The 
   problem description uses logic, and "solving" the problem often looks like automatically proving a system of logical axioms. 
   Examples for such programming languages are Prolog,XSLT, LISP and SQL.

   Imperative programming languages describe a system of state changes. At the start, the program is in a certain state, and 
   the computer is given steps to follow, in order to perform an action. Following the steps causes the program to "change 
   state".

   In general, declarative programming languages are safer and shorter. Imperative programming languages are more common, 
   because they are easier to use.

   <u><b>Functional vs. Procedural:-</b></u>
   Functional programming looks at programming like a function in mathematics. The program receives input, together 
   with some information, and uses this information to create output. It will not have a state in between, and it will also not 
   change things that are not related to the computation.

   Procedural programs specify or describe sets of steps or state changes.

   <u><b>Stack-based:-</b></u>
   Stack-based languages look at some of the program's memory like a stack of cards. There are very few things that can be done 
   with a stack. A data item can be put on the top of the stack. This operation is generally called "push". A data item can be 
   removed from the top of the stack. This is called a "pop". You can look at the item at the top of the stack without removing 
   it. This is called a "peek".
